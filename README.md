# HDI Analysis of African Countries (2025)

This project analyzes the **Human Development Index (HDI)** for African countries using indicators such as **Life Expectancy**, **Schooling**, and **GNI per capita**.  
The goal is to identify the 10 countries with the lowest HDI in 2025 and visualize how different factors affect development.
