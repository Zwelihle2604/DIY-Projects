      "source": "Introduction\n\nThe Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an intergovernmental body that sets global standards for combating money laundering, terrorist financing, and related financial crimes. This data analysis examines the composition of FATF member countries and the jurisdictions currently identified on its grey and black lists. The analysis explores geographic distribution, economic indicators, and governance metrics to highlight patterns in compliance and risk exposure. FATF members are assessed for adherence to its 40 Recommendations, while grey-listed countries are under increased monitoring for identified deficiencies, and blacklisted countries face calls for action due to significant strategic weaknesses. By quantifying and comparing these groups, the report aims to provide data-driven insights into global financial integrity, regional trends, and the relationship between FATF status and broader economic and regulatory performance.",

Studies estimate a decline in capital inflows.\n  - Real-world examples: IMF estimates grey-listing may cause about 7.6% of GDP decline in capital inflows. South Africa’s case shows potential shrinkage in FDI.\n\n• Higher compliance / operational costs\n  - What it means in practice: Domestic financial and non-financial institutions face stricter due diligence, more paperwork, slower transaction processing, and higher borrowing costs.\n  - Real-world examples: South African banks reported increased cost of cross-border flows; companies face higher cost of capital.\n\n• Impact on correspondent banking & cross-border flows\n  - What it means in practice: Foreign banks may reduce or terminate correspondent banking relationships, hampering trade finance, remittances, and exports/imports.\n  - Real-world examples: Botswana (grey-listed 2018–2021) saw disruptions in correspondent banking relationships.\n\n• Risk of credit rating downgrades / higher borrowing costs\n  - What it means in practice: Increased perceived risk can lead to sovereign credit rating downgrades, making borrowing costlier and debt servicing harder.\n  - Real-world examples: South Africa’s grey-listing was linked to concerns about its sovereign credit outlook.\n\n• Trade and finance disruption\n  - What it means in practice: Trading partners and multilateral institutions may impose heightened scrutiny, slower processing of transactions, and more expensive trade finance.\n  - Real-world examples: Mauritius (grey-listed 2020–2022) experienced payment delays and investors relocating funds.\n\n• Incentive / pressure to undertake reforms\n  - What it means in practice: Being on the list pressures countries to strengthen AML/CFT regimes; failure to reform can risk escalation to black-listing.\n  - Real-world examples: Mauritius and Botswana implemented FATF action plans and successfully exited the grey list.\n\n"
